        <p class="intro">Hello Coast Guard Yeoman and welcome to Microsoft Teams USCG Yeoman.  Microsoft Teams
            offers many functionalities such as online meetings, screen sharing, file sharing
            and instant messaging.  Within the team, there are 6 channels (Administration, Pay
            and Personnel, Reserves, Travel and Transportation, EPME and SWE Study).  Team members
            can post information, upload documents, create folders and much more.  This is a great
            platform to colaborate and ensure accurate and updated information is being shared.
        <br>
        <br>
        One of the main channels of the team is SWE Study.  Within this channel is stored RPQ / EPQ
        files, references and the 2020 November SWE Questions Excel spreadsheet.  The purpose of this
        channel is for Yeoman to network about SWE information.  In the beginning of
        January 2021, an online study group will be established.

        <b>Step Two:</b>  Within a few minutes, you will receive an automated email.  Follow the instructions
        to setup your account.  During the setup, you will enable a Multi Factor Authentication.  What

        through the Microsoft Authenticator Application or receive a call on your cell phone.  It is 
        HIGHLY recommended that you use the cell phone method.
